Recently, Brave announced the first step of our goal to bring Leoâ€”our privacy-preserving AI assistant in the browserâ€”to Brave mobile with our Android release. 

Today, Brave is happy to announce the completion of this goal, with the release of Leo for iOS. iPhone and iPad users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages and PDFs, translate pages, create content, and more from the browser address bar.

Leo enables natural conversations on a wide range of topics. With AI built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way.

For the second half of our mobile launch, weâ€™ve added in a special feature available only on iOS. With voice-to-text capability, iOS users can speak their input and have it converted to text without needing to type. This streamlines the interaction and makes conveying information to the AI assistant even easier. Couple this with document integrations and new models like Mixtral, and Leo for iOS becomes a powerful, mobile AI assistant you can take with you wherever you go.

What can Leo do?

Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages youâ€™re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:

Create real-time summaries of webpages and PDFs

Answer questions about content

Get instant answers for queries

Generate new long-form written content such as reports, articles, or social media

Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them

Write and suggest software code for multiple languages 

In addition to these great core use cases, we integrated Leo in the Brave browser app especially with mobile users in mind, including:

Voice-to-text: Use your iOS deviceâ€™s voice-to-text functionality to speak prompts directly to Leo, converting your spoken words into written text without typing.

Docs and PDF summaries: Leo can summarize different types of content filesâ€”including PDFsâ€”making it much easier to consume dense content on a small screen.

Google Docs integration: You can use Leo to power your mobile productivity with the Google Docs and Google Sheets integration. Brainstorm and assist on writing, create quick summaries, translate, and more.

With Leo on iOS, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, thereâ€™s no login or signup requiredâ€”you just open your browser and chat.

Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers

Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.

Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtralâ€”the default LLMâ€”can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. 

Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, according to the BBQ benchmark.

For all these reasons, we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for Leo on desktop, and weâ€™ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for iOS as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.
